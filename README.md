# serverclientminer

Storage for source code, don't expect it to work if you clone.

Some useful commands
```
chmod +x ./build.sh
chmod +x ./testserver.sh
chmod +x ./client.sh
git clone git@github.com:taskflow/taskflow.git
git clone git@github.com:okdshin/PicoSHA2.git
```

Some pieces of code are commented out, they should still work if they're uncommented, just beware of clashes between functions
